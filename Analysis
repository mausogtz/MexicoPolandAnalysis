### Mexico's Formation Analysis

Mexico started with a 433 Holding, in which Edson Álvarez worked in that CDM role but had tendencies to open up to the left instead of dropping down as other CDMs do to receive the ball. One important aspect we can see in the first half is the dominance on the left hand side, as Henry and Edson preferred receieving the ball on that side. Another key aspect that we can see and feel throughout the game is the lack of involvement of Herrera throughout the first half. As we can see he tends to received the ball behind the line of Polish midfielders which can be difficult as he is hidden at times. Also, we can see how Chávez tends to start as close to the sideline as possible. This was seen as a problem for Mexico since the midfield was to spread over the field and the link up was problematic at times. As we can see Vega, Gallardo and Chavez all clashed at the sideline since they tend to all be in those zones. As for the right hand side Chucky and Jorge understood their role correcltly as Jorge went inside as Chucky opened up, this generated some chances in the first half. As for Henry his task for the First Half was to drop down and receive the ball close the the half which was difficult since the help from the other players was not normally there. As for the CBs, watching the game we could see that they loved to try long passes across the field to the wingers, which in theory was a good effort, but actually they did not create that many opportunities.
